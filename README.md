## Chapter 1 Day 1 
1. Blockchain is open decentralized public database. So everybody can see information that is stored there.
2. Smart Contracts are programs, or "rulebooks" that developers make. Smart Contracts are fast, and there is no middleman. The Blockchain, and thus Smart Contracts, are extremely secure if we make them that way. Hard to get right: While Smart Contracts are cool, they are NOT smart. Can be malicious if the developer is mean. must make sure you interact with Smart Contracts that you know are secure. Cannot undo something
3. a transaction CHANGES the data on the Blockchain and a script is used to VIEW data on the Blockchain, script do not change it
4. Mainnet is real and public blockchain and all changes there effect to real in the blockchain. Testnet is for coding, testing dapps and learning and are not effecting to real in the blockchain. When would you develop on each? 1st Testnet until Dapp etc. is ready for public and when code / Dapp is ready to public release then develop / release it to Mainnet.
