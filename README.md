## Chapter 1 Day 1 
1. Blockchain is open decentralized public database. So everybody can see information that is stored there.
2. Smart Contracts are programs, or "rulebooks" that developers make. Smart Contracts are fast, and there is no middleman. The Blockchain, and thus Smart Contracts, are extremely secure if we make them that way. Hard to get right: While Smart Contracts are cool, they are NOT smart. Can be malicious if the developer is mean. must make sure you interact with Smart Contracts that you know are secure. Cannot undo something
3. a transaction CHANGES the data on the Blockchain and a script is used to VIEW data on the Blockchain, script do not change it
4. Mainnet is real and public blockchain and all changes there effect to real in the blockchain. Testnet is for coding, testing dapps and learning and are not effecting to real in the blockchain. When would you develop on each? 1st Testnet until Dapp etc. is ready for public and when code / Dapp is ready to public release then develop / release it to Mainnet.

## Chapter 2 Day 1
1. frontend is visible site of application that users can see and where they communicate with app / dapp. backend is e.g. database in the cloud server where all App data is stored.
2. global styling effect everything in the program and module styling effect / applies to files they are imported in

## Chapter 3 Day 2
  
1. Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script?
  Script is for viewing smart contract not for modifying it and changeGreeting purpose is modify the blockchain data.
  
2. What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
  Every time a user sends a transaction, you have to pay for the transaction, and then you "sign" it. All that means is you clicked a button saying "hey, I want to approve this transaction." When you sign it, the transaction takes in your AuthAccount and can access the data in your account. So AuthAccount is to approve and sign transaction, like opening the access for the information/data in the account
  
3. What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
  Prepare is opening / signing the access for the information/data in the account / smart contract and then execute is phase where transaction (change data in the blockchain) itself is happening. (You could technically do everything in the prepare phase, but the code is less clear that way. It's better to separate the logic.)
   
4.a
  Add two new things inside your contract:
```cadence
    pub contract HelloWorld {
        pub var greeting: String
        pub var myNumber: Int
        pub fun changeGreeting(newGreeting: String) {
            self.greeting = newGreeting
        }
        pub fun updateMyNumber(newNumber: Int){
            self.myNumber = newNumber
        }
        init() {
            self.greeting = "Hello, World!"
            self.myNumber = 0
        }
    }
```

4.b Add a script that reads myNumber from the contract
```cadence
import HelloWorld from 0x01

pub fun main(): Int {
    return HelloWorld.myNumber
}
```
4.c Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named myNewNumber and passes it into the updateMyNumber function. Verify that your number changed by running the script again.
```cadence
import HelloWorld from 0x01
transaction(myNewNumber: Int) {
  prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {
  }
  execute {
    HelloWorld.updateMyNumber(newNumber: myNewNumber)
  }
}
```  
## Chapter 3 Day 3
  
 Create a new smart contract in Cadence that has at least the following two things:
 A variable to hold a value (like a number or a piece of text) and A function to change that variable.
 
 ``` cadence
 pub contract HelloWorld {

    pub var greeting: String

    pub fun changeGreeting(newGreeting: String) {
        self.greeting = newGreeting
    }

    init() {
        self.greeting = "Hello, Sami!"
    }
}
```

## Chapter 4 Day 1:

1. How did we get the address of the user? Please explain in words and then in code?

We need to connect users crypto wallet to our Dapp. 
And we do that with this code:

<img width="765" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 15 41 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114108357/198286993-4c6b7292-74b7-4c29-b513-8115e38e5ef6.png">

2. What do fcl.authenticate and fcl.unauthenticate do?

fcl.authenticat logs the user in
fcl.unauthenticate logs the user out

3a Why did we make a config.js file?

Because Jacob always do that for his projects (That's what he said) :) ... He do it most probably keeping again code clean and nice and different functions in the own file. This file now configurate connection to our Dapp to Flow TestNet (it could be also emulator or MainNet).

3b What does it do?

What this does is it connects our DApp to Flow TestNet and tells our DApp that when we go to log in, we can log in to Blocto & Lilico Wallet (which are both a part of something called "FCL Discovery").


4. What does our useEffect do?

useEffect is a function that runs every time something happens. That "something" comes from what is put inside the [] brackets. because [] is empty, this means "every time the page is refreshed".

5. How do we import FCL?

1st we need to install FCL, or the Flow Client Library in our terminal and type npm install @onflow/fcl.
then we Importing & Connecting FCL with config.js -file.

6. What does fcl.currentUser.subscribe(setUser); do?

It making sure the user variable retains its value even if the page is refreshed with useEffect.

## Chapter 4 Day 2:

1. Instead of console logging the result after the script executes, I want you to:

2a. I deployed a contract called SimpleTest to an account with an address of 0x6c0d53c676256e8c. I want you to make a button that, when clicked, executes a script to read the number variable from that contract. If you're curious, you can see the contract here:

2b. Then, I want you to remove the button, and make the script execute every time the page refreshes.

## Chapter 4 Day 3:

Write a function that executes a script with all the Cadence types that we reviewed today. Call the script when the page refreshes. Return something random from the Cadence script, and console log it to prove to me your script actually worked.

## Chapter 4 day 4:

1. I deployed a contract called SimpleTest to an account with an address of 0x6c0d53c676256e8c. I want you to make a button that, when clicked, sends a transaction to change the number variable from that contract.
